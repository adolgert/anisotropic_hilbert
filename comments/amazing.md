  A Speculation: Is There a "Lifted Gray Code"?                                                                                
                                                                                                                               
  The Gray code $G: V_n \to V_n$ is linear. The scan over $\mathcal{H}$ looks like a "higher" or "lifted" version of Gray code 
  that operates on sequences of vectors rather than individual vectors.                                                        
                                                                                                                               
  Define a map on $(V_n)^m$:                                                                                                   
  $$\tilde{G}: (V_n)^m \to (V_n)^m$$                                                                                           
                                                                                                                               
  Is the Hilbert encoding expressible as $\tilde{G}$ composed with some permutation and parallel local operations?
